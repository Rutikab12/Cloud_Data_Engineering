  Fill null or empty values
  
  Filter (if needed)
  
  Standardize gender column
  
  Drop duplicates
  
  Store to BigQuery

LeetCode Problem

  Two Sum (O(n²) and O(n) solutions).

BigQuery Concepts

  What is a dataset in BigQuery?
  
  RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER — write example and code.
  
  Partitions, clustering in BigQuery.
  
  Can we do clustering on already existing BQ tables? (syntax for partitioning and clustering)

Use Case

  Data in Oracle DB → read it (e.g., Dataflow) → process → store to BigQuery in incremental manner:

Append new records

    Update existing records if updated
    (You answered using MERGE in BQ; they expected CDC concepts)
